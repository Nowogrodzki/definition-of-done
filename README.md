#Definition of Done

>The **definition of done** is exactly what you think: a list of criteria that has to be met before any work can be considered **done**. _Failure to meet any one of these conditions means the work is not complete_.

##Why?
At **_dwyl_**, we consider the _definition of done_ to be one of the most important parts of a project [if not **_the_ most important**](https://github.com/dwyl/summer-2015/issues/42).
 
Having this means that everyone who works with dwyl **knows what to aim for** in terms of code quality which facilitates the integration with the rest of our codebase and _saves everyone time_, which is of course [our stated aim](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/blob/master/manifesto.md)!

##Definition of Done
We will keep adding detail and examples to this as we gain understanding of any ambiguities that come up.

For clarity, a task will not be considered to be complete until all these items can be checked off.

- [ ] Code updates come with a corresponding update to the documentation
- [ ] Front end features should be user-tested and notes should exist on this testing
* [ ] **100% test coverage**
* [ ] **All tests pass**
* [ ] **Descriptive pull request text**, answering:

  + What does this PR implement and how? 
* [ ] **Assign your PR to someone** for a code review
  + This person _will be contacted **first**_ if a bug is introduced into `master`
